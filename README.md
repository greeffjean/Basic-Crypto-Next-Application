# Crypto Shipto Test Applciation 🍎 

### Goal - 
1. Create Next application that utilises **static-generated** and **server-side-generated** props, accompanied with the `react-query` React library, with which we will make use of **data pre-fetching.**

2. API we will use is - `https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json` and `https://catfact.ninja/fact`

> NB Note for developer - In development mode (when you run npm run dev or yarn dev), pages are pre-rendered on every request. This also applies to Static Generation to make it easier to develop. When going to production, Static Generation will happen once, at build time, and not on every request.
